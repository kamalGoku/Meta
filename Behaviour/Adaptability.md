# ADAPTABILITY

[https://www.metaview.ai/resources/interview-questions/adaptability]

Question: "Can you recall an experience where your adaptability was crucial in navigating through a situation?"
Answer:

Situation:
While working at Amazon, I was tasked with implementing a device name synchronisation service — a system to ensure the device name on the 
local device stays in sync with the name stored in the cloud. This involved complex synchronisation logic, and the requirements from stakeholders
were initially vague, with limited documentation or clear inputs.

Task:
I initially proposed a generic synchronisation module that could support not only device names but also future synchronization needs across components. 
The estimated timeline for this robust solution was around two months. However, after reviewing the proposal, the client asked for a working version within 
Just one month, given some business urgency.

Action:
Rather than insisting on the original design or pushing back on the timeline, I adapted by narrowing the scope of the implementation to focus specifically 
on device name synchronization. I reused an existing synchronization module as the foundation and customised it to fit the immediate needs. 
This approach allowed me to bypass the lengthy approval and integration process for a brand-new generic framework, while still ensuring the implementation 
was reliable and extensible for future improvements.

Result:
The revised solution was delivered within the one-month deadline and worked as expected in production. The client was satisfied with the outcome, and the
streamlined path ensured minimal disruption. Importantly, the core logic I built later served as a reference for future synchronization tasks, providing long-term value.

Reflection:
This experience taught me that being adaptable doesn’t mean compromising quality — it means balancing long-term vision with short-term impact.
By embracing ambiguity early and adjusting my approach pragmatically, I delivered a valuable solution under time pressure, which is a mindset 
I carry forward in fast-paced environments like Meta.
