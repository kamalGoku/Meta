# GROWN MINDSET

1) Same story as "perseverance"
2) Growth Mindset: Taking on Firmware Design Without Prior Experience

S – Situation:
When I joined Marvell, one of my first major responsibilities was to design a Telemetry and Monitoring system at the firmware level. Until then, my experience had been primarily in hardware abstraction and application layers — I had never worked this close to the metal. The firmware domain was new to me, and the task came with tight constraints on memory, performance, and hardware access, making it a significant technical leap outside my comfort zone.

T – Task:
My goal was to design a robust telemetry solution that could monitor system health and report critical metrics in real time, all within the firmware environment. This meant understanding deep hardware interactions, resource usage patterns, and boot-time considerations — all while ensuring minimal performance overhead. The timeline was aggressive, and the system had to be production-ready within five months.

A – Action:
Instead of pushing back or asking for a more familiar task, I embraced the challenge as a growth opportunity. I took the following deliberate steps to upskill and succeed:

Self-Initiated Learning: I spent the first few weeks diving into Marvell’s firmware codebase, reviewing internal documentation, and studying similar open-source implementations to understand best practices.

Collaboration with Domain Experts: I set up regular syncs with senior firmware engineers and hardware SMEs to clarify performance constraints, memory layout concerns, and register-level limitations. These conversations were invaluable in avoiding rookie mistakes and deepening my domain understanding.

Incremental Prototyping: To accelerate learning, I built small proof-of-concepts that tested individual telemetry components — like memory usage monitors and temperature sensors — and used them to validate design choices early.

Feedback Loops: I conducted design reviews at each stage with senior leads, actively seeking constructive feedback and iterating on my design. I welcomed critiques instead of avoiding them and made substantial improvements based on their input.

R – Result:
After about two months, I delivered a well-structured design that earned buy-in from senior engineers. I then completed the implementation and testing in the next three months. The system was successfully deployed in production and became the baseline for telemetry in other projects. More importantly, this experience transformed my confidence in working across unfamiliar domains, and I’ve since taken on multiple firmware-related initiatives.

I also documented my learnings and created a “firmware onboarding guide” for other engineers transitioning from higher layers of the stack — helping to scale that growth across the team.
