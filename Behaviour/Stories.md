## Managing Large Scale/Ambiguous projects

DONTs:
- A sense of helplessness when presented with an ambiguous problem
- Conveying a sense of displeasure or being annoyed when handed an unclear problem
- Not understanding the goals of the project well enough Not taking the time to understand the problem space and what other work streams for this already exist

- Gathering data to build or verify a hypothesis and
- Understanding who the domain experts are leveraging their knowledge

## Managing Priorities/Deadlines
Common Questions:
### How do you prioritize work streams when you are involved in more than one?
### How do you handle a situation when a partner team has different priorities than yours?
### Tell me about a time when a project took longer than expected and missed a deadline?

For questions like these, what we want to convey here is that we:
- Understand the higher-level goals of the team/project and align our priorities with this.
- For issues of conflicting priorties it again comes down to dealing with conflict and being open to compromise and coming to a mutually agreeable solution.
- When it comes to not meeting deadlines, it's important not to point fingers and blame shift. Take accountability when things are your fault and
make sure that partners are informed of the setbacks and why they are happening.

## Dealing with Feedback/Criticism:
This next class of question relates to how you react when you receive criticism or constructive feedback about your performance and actions.
This question is great for assessing your maturity as an engineer and whether you are able to take actionable steps from feedback.

DONTS:
+ Taking feedback personally
+ Rejecting it outright without objective consideration
+ Not taking positive action going forward
+ Not asking for clarification in areas that you disagree. Remember that not all feedback will be applicable or realistic. You don't have to be a pushover

DOS: 
+ Being open to feedback
+ Accepting when you messed up and that could have done better
+ Taking actionable steps to improve in the future

## Convincing Others of Your Perspective/Idea:
The penultimate class of question I want to do discuss is one which revolves around how you're able to win people over to your side.
This question has many forms but at it's simplest we're answering the question of:
Tell me about a time you had to convince a coworker/partner/leadership of something?

DONTs:
- believe me because I said so
- do this because I told you to do it
- being pushy and not understanding the priorities and wants of the other party

DOs:
+ We use facts and data to present an objective argument to the other party
+ That we fully understand the other party's point of view and take this into account in our proposed solution
+ Be willing to compromise and not insist that we do everything one way and only one way + have confidence in your convictions and be willing to fight for your position instead of being a pushover at the first sign of pushback.
