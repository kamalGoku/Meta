# ONLINE AUCTION

## High-Level Design

### 1) Users should be able to post an item for auction with a starting price and end date.
### 2) Users should be able to bid on an item. Bids that are higher than the current highest bid are accepted.
### 3) Users should be able to view an auction, including the current highest bid.

## Deep Dives 
### 1) How can we ensure strong consistency for bids?
### 2) How can we ensure the system is fault-tolerant and durable?
### 3) How can we ensure the system displays the current highest bid in real-time?
### 4) How can we ensure the system scales to support 10M concurrent auctions?
